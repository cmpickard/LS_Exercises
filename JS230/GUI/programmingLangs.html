// Create a collection of programming languages of your choice.
// Display a heading and a paragraph for each programming language.
// Initially, display the first 120 characters for each paragraph.
// There is a Show More button for each programming language.

// Functionality
// When the user clicks the Show More button:
// Display the entire paragraph about the corresponding language.
// Change the button text to Show Less.

// When the user clicks the Show Less button:
// Change the button text to Show More.
// Hide all but the first 120 characters of the paragraph text.

        <h1>Ruby</h1>
        <p>Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose
          programming language. It was designed and developed in
          t<span class="continuation" id="ruby-text">he mid-1990s by
            Yukihiro Matsumoto in Japan. According to its creator, Ruby was
            influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp. It supports
            multiple programming paradigms, including functional,
            object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic type
            system and automatic memory management

        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <p>JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted
          programming language. It has been standardized in the ECM
          <span class="continuation" id="javascript-text">Script language
            specification. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the
            three core technologies of World Wide Web content production;
            the majority of websites employ it, and all modern Web browsers
            support it without the need for plug-ins. JavaScript is
            prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a
            multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative,
            and functional programming styles

        <p>Lisp (historically, LISP) is a family of computer programming
          languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully par

            Originally specified in 1958, Lisp is the second-oldest high-level
            programming language in widespread use today. Only Fortran is
            older, by one year. Lisp has changed since its early days, and
            many dialects have existed over its history. Today, the best
            known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Common Lisp and Scheme
