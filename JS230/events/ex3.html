<!-- The code above is buggy. The person who created the code expects that
nothing will happen when the user clicks on the image. This, however,
isn't the case; clicking the image still brings the user to another web page.

Study the code and explain the bug. -->

<!-- ANSWER:
the author is assuming that there is no default behavior triggered when one
clicks on teh img element. but that's not true. precisely b/c the img element
is nested inside of the <a> element, it still counts as part of the anchor, and
thus, clicking on the img element triggers an event with the default behavior
of following the href value of the anchor tag in which it's embedded.
to solve this problem, we should add the line,
event.preventDefault() 
inside the event handler function
