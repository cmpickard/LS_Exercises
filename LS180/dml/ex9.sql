-- We've realized that the last two parts we're using for device number 2, 
-- "Gyroscope", actually belong to an "Accelerometer". Write an SQL statement that
--  will associate the last two parts from our parts table with an "Accelerometer"
--   instead of a "Gyroscope".

UPDATE parts SET device_id = 1 WHERE part_number = 7 OR part_number = 8;

-- Further Exploration
-- What if we wanted to set the part with the smallest part_number to be 
-- associated with "Gyroscope"? How would we go about doing that?

UPDATE parts SET device_id = 2 WHERE part_number = (SELECT min(part_number) FROM parts);
