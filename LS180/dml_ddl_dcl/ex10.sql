-- Does the following statement use the DDL or DML component of SQL?

-- CREATE SEQUENCE part_number_sequence;

-- ANSWER: Same deal as last time. There's a sense in which we could justifiably
-- think of this as a DML statement, but it's more apt to consider all CREATE 
-- statements, including this one, a part of DDL.
