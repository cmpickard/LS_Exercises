-- Does the following statement use the DDL or DML component of SQL?

-- CREATE TABLE things (
--   id serial PRIMARY KEY,
--   item text NOT NULL UNIQUE,
--   material text NOT NULL
-- );

-- ANSWER: This is using DDL since here we are creating a new table and designing
-- it's schema but NOT actually manipulating any data for the table yet.
