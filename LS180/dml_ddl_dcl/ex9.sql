-- Does the following statement use the DDL or DML component of SQL?

-- DROP DATABASE xyzzy;

-- ANSWER: This is using the DDL component of SQL. Although we are, in some sense,
-- manipulating the data inside the database (by destroying it all), it's more apt
-- to think of this as a use of DDL.
-- IN GENERAL all DROP statements are considered part of DDL.
