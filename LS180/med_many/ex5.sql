-- This won't be easy! Hint: you will need to use the window lag function together
--  with a CASE condition in your SELECT. To get you started, try this command:

-- SELECT customers.name,
--        lag(customers.name)
--          OVER (ORDER BY customers.name)
--          AS previous,
--        services.description
-- FROM customers
-- LEFT OUTER JOIN customers_services
--              ON customer_id = customers.id
-- LEFT OUTER JOIN services
--              ON services.id = service_id;


-- Examine the relationship between the previous column and the rest of the table
--  to get a handle on what lag does.
