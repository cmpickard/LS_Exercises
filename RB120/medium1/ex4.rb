# A circular buffer is a collection of objects stored in a buffer that is treated 
# as though it is connected end-to-end in a circle. When an object is added to 
# this circular buffer, it is added to the position that immediately follows the 
# most recently added object, while removing an object always removes the object
#  that has been in the buffer the longest.

# This works as long as there are empty spots in the buffer. If the buffer
#  becomes full, adding a new object to the buffer requires getting rid of an 
#  existing object; with a circular buffer, the object that has been in the 
#  buffer the longest is discarded and replaced by the new object.

# Assuming we have a circular buffer with room for 3 objects, the circular 
# buffer looks and acts like this:

# P1	P2	P3	Comments
# All positions are initially empty
# 1			Add 1 to the buffer
# 1	2		Add 2 to the buffer
# 2		Remove oldest item from the buffer (1)
# 2	3	Add 3 to the buffer
# 4	2	3	Add 4 to the buffer, buffer is now full
# 4		3	Remove oldest item from the buffer (2)
# 4	5	3	Add 5 to the buffer, buffer is full again
# 4	5	6	Add 6 to the buffer, replaces oldest element (3)
# 7	5	6	Add 7 to the buffer, replaces oldest element (4)
# 7		6	Remove oldest item from the buffer (5)
# 7			Remove oldest item from the buffer (6)
# Remove oldest item from the buffer (7)
# Remove non-existent item from the buffer (nil)
# Your task is to write a CircularBuffer class that implements a circular buffer 
# for arbitrary objects. The class should obtain the buffer size with an argument
#    provided to CircularBuffer::new, and should provide the following methods:

# put to add an object to the buffer
# get to remove (and return) the oldest object in the buffer. It should return 
# nil if the buffer is empty.
# You may assume that none of the values stored in the buffer are nil (however, 
# nil may be used to designate empty spots in the buffer).

# Examples:
# buffer = CircularBuffer.new(3)
# puts buffer.get == nil

# buffer.put(1)
# buffer.put(2)
# puts buffer.get == 1

# buffer.put(3)
# buffer.put(4)
# puts buffer.get == 2

# buffer.put(5)
# buffer.put(6)
# buffer.put(7)
# puts buffer.get == 5
# puts buffer.get == 6
# puts buffer.get == 7
# puts buffer.get == nil

# buffer = CircularBuffer.new(4)
# puts buffer.get == nil

# buffer.put(1)
# buffer.put(2)
# puts buffer.get == 1

# buffer.put(3)
# buffer.put(4)
# puts buffer.get == 2

# buffer.put(5)
# buffer.put(6)
# buffer.put(7)
# puts buffer.get == 4
# puts buffer.get == 5
# puts buffer.get == 6
# puts buffer.get == 7
# puts buffer.get == nil
# The above code should display true 15 times.
