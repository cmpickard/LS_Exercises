# Thus far, we've used iterators often. You've seen the use of #each and #map 
# used on various data structures, such as Arrays and Hashes. These methods make 
# writing certain code a bit easier, at least when compared to a while or for loop. 
# Yet, what we've seen thus far is only part of what is available.

# Whenever we use map or each on something like an Array, we're using something
#  called "Internal Iteration". It's called that because the process and 
#  implementation of that iteration is hidden from us, and the process that 
#  allows us to progress through a collection is part of that hidden 
#  implementation.

# There's also "External Iteration". This is iteration that takes place at the 
# behest of the user. Ruby gives us the option to use this type of iteration with 
# the Enumerator class. For this exercise, lets take a bit of a tour of the 
# capabilities of Enumerator. While we do that, let's make something interesting 
#   with it.

# In this exercise, your task is to create a new Enumerator object. When creating 
# a new Enumerator, you may define what values are iterated upon. We'll want to 
# create an Enumerator that can iterate over an infinite list of factorials. 
# Once you make this new Enumerator, test it out by printing out the first 7 
# factorial values, starting with zero factorial.

# More specifically, print the first 7 factorials by using an "External Iterator". 
# Once you have done so, see what happens if you print 3 more factorials. Now, 
# reset your Enumerator (use the rewind method). Finally, print 7 more factorials.

# You can find almost everything you need for this exercise in the documentation 
# for Enumerator. In particular, check out the ::new method; it should prove a 
# good starting point for this exercise. Some further details about internal vs 
# external iterators are mentioned at the start of that documentation, so make 
# sure to read that section. That section is a bit dense at places; if you don't 
# understand everything about it, that's ok.

# A factorial is a mathematical operation that involves multiplying a bunch of 
# sequential positive numbers together. They are usually written as a non-negative 
# integer followed by an exclamation point, e.g., 4!. The values look like this:

# n	n!	notes
# 0	1	By definition, 0! is 1
# 1	1	By definition, 1! is 1
# 2	2	2! = 2 * 1
# 3	6	3! = 3 * 2 * 1
# 4	24	4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
# 5	120	5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
# The factorial values (0!, 1!, 2!, etc.) follow a simple pattern. First, 0! and 
# 1! are both defined to be 1. All subsequent factorials are the result of 
# multiplying all the integers from 1 up to the n value together. 
# Thus, 5! is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, or 120.

# The wikipedia page on factorials may also be of some use.

# Two final hints:

# You'll only need 3 Enumerator methods to complete this exercise.
# An Enumerator also implements the Enumerable module. Keep this in mind, as it 
# may make certain parts of this exercise easier to write.

factorial = Enumerator.new do |yieldee|
  current_factorial = 0
  current_value = 1
  loop do
    yieldee << current_value
    current_factorial += 1
    current_value = (current_value == 0 ? 1 : current_value * current_factorial)
  end
end

# Print the first 7 factorials by using an "External Iterator". 
# Once you have done so, see what happens if you print 3 more factorials. Now, 
# reset your Enumerator (use the rewind method). 
# Finally, print 7 more factorials.
