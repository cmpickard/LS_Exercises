# In our Ruby course content on blocks, we learn about "symbol to proc" and how 
# it works. To review briefly, consider this code:

# comparator = proc { |a, b| b <=> a }
# and the Array#sort method, which expects a block argument to express how the 
# Array will be sorted. If we want to use comparator to sort the Array, we have
#  a problem: it is a proc, not a block. The following code:

# array.sort(comparator)
# fails with an ArgumentError. To get around this, we can use the proc to block 
# operator & to convert comparator to a block:

# array.sort(&comparator)
# This now works as expected, and we sort the Array in reverse order.

# When applied to an argument object for a method, a lone & causes ruby to try 
# to convert that object to a block. If that object is a proc, the conversion 
# happens automatically, just as shown above. If the object is not a proc, then 
# & attempts to call the #to_proc method on the object first. Used with symbols,
#  e.g., &:to_s, Ruby creates a proc that calls the #to_s method on a passed 
#  object, and then converts that proc to a block. This is the "symbol to proc" 
#  operation (though perhaps it should be called "symbol to block").

# Note that &, when applied to an argument object is not the same as an & applied 
# to a method parameter, as in this code:

# def foo(&block)
#   block.call
# end
# While & applied to an argument object causes the object to be converted to a 
# block, & applied to a method parameter causes the associated block to be 
# converted to a proc. In essence, the two uses of & are opposites.

# Did you know that you can perform a similar trick with methods? You can apply 
# the & operator to an object of the Method class, which is created by Object#method. In doing so, Ruby can call Method#to_proc.

# Using this information, together with the course page linked above, fill in the 
# missing part of the following code so we can convert an array of integers to 
# base 8 (octal numbers). Use the comments for help in determining where to make 
# your modifications, and make sure to review the "Approach/Algorithm" section 
# for this exercise; it should prove useful.

# # Replace the two `method_name` placeholders with actual method calls
# def convert_to_base_8(n)
#   n.method_name.method_name
# end

# # Replace `argument` with the correct argument below
# # `method` is `Object#method`, not a placeholder
# base8_proc = method(argument).to_proc

# # We'll need a Proc object to make this code work
# # Replace `a_proc` with the correct object
# [8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 33].map(&a_proc)

# # The expected return value of map on this number array should be:
# # [10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 41]

def to_octal(int)
  result_str = ''
  result = int
  while result > 7
    result, remainder = result.divmod(8)

  result_str << result.to_s
